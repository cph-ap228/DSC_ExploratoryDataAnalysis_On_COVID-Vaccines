### BigProject_DSC - Exploratory Data Analysis on COVID

___________________________________
## ✔️ Idea: Exploratory Data Analysis on the severity of COVID parameters and Vaccination statistics.
### Focus of *interest*:
It has been well over a year since the world got shaken up by these fast-spreading microscopic creatures, and has changed everyday life for the majority of people all around the world. This pandemic has been the result of plenty conspiracy theories surfacing, questioning many governments and approaches to how to deal with the virus. This has also led to a huge shift in the medical sector that is working day and night to try to suffocate the wider spread of the virus, in an attempt to normalize the way we human beings live. This is with no question the most discussed topic in the recent decade, where everyone is eager for answers.
### Why is it *interesting?*:
It's first and foremost extremely relevant. An Exploratory Data Analysis on this topic provides valuable knowledge in all the attributes the virus possesses and the outcoming factors from countries all over the world. This research will provide the most seeked after an valuable statistical data on all behavioral states on the virus and human beings. Secondly it brings a light on the inevitable default null hypothesis of that no vaccine can be 100% effective, and that not all data is published and/or true, and despite that a common nominator is that a global spike of COVID cases is still present, despite a huge growth of vaccinated people all over the world. 
### Which outcome do you expect from your research?:
A statistical research that can provide answers on the development of the virus since it surfaced. A hypothesis that still stands true based on the results as a proof of the determining factors that the most well-off countries around the world have taken into practise, in an attempt to stop the wide spread of the virus within their borders. Futhermore that all related exploratory data has been data mined, discussed and visualized.
### Who's the target *audience/our users?*:
Health Authorities around the worlds within governments, WHO, Data Analysts, Business Strategists and Analysts, Medical Sector and Vaccine Distributors.

Described as an use case: A Business Strategist or Researcher could supply themselves with the provided analysis and survey data in how economy and businesses have been affected, and create a strategy for current appliable businesses in how to operate their business infrastructure in other means, despite the pandemic.

# Stage 3: 
## Hypothesis Testing 
#### 1. Create a model to support your null hypothesis.
#### 2. Search for evidence to reject it.
#### 3. Assess the significance of the evidence.
#### 4. Visualise and interpret the results.
#### 5. Create the second prototype of your data science story.
#### 6. Export your solution files to your git repository.
